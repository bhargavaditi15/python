import turtle #This imports the turtle module, which allows you to control a graphical turtle to draw shapes and lines.
t=turtle.Turtle () #This creates a turtle object t. The turtle can be thought of as a "pen" that moves around and draws on the screen.
s=turtle.Screen() #This creates a screen object s, which is the window where the turtle will draw.
s.bgcolor ('black') #This sets the background color of the drawing screen to black.
t.width(3) #This sets the width of the turtle's pen to 3 units, making the lines it draws thicker.
t.speed(25) #This sets the turtle's drawing speed. The higher the number, the faster the turtle moves.
col=('magenta','yellow','green') #This defines a tuple col with three colors: magenta, yellow, and green. The turtle will switch between these colors while drawing.
for i in range (500): #This is a loop that runs 500 times, where i takes values from 0 to 499.
   t.forward(i*4) #This moves the turtle forward by a distance of i * 4 units. As i increases, the distance the turtle moves forward increases, creating larger spirals.
   t.right(121) # This makes the turtle turn right by 121 degrees after moving forward. The specific angle (121 degrees) causes the turtle to draw a spiral-like pattern.
